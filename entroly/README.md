# Entroly 🤖🧠

**A self-evolving daemon that "dreams" about your codebase to cure AI hallucination.**

Every AI coding tool manages context with dumb FIFO truncation — blindly stuffing tokens until the window is full, then chopping off the top. This causes your agents to hallucinate, loop endlessly, and burn API credits.

Entroly acts as an **Epistemic Firewall**. It sits locally on `localhost:9377` and intercepts traffic between your editor (Cursor, Claude Code, Copilot) and the LLM. 

When you close your laptop, Entroly's background daemon wakes up. It crawls your repository, structurally induces the architecture, and pre-fetches answers. When you open your editor the next day, the agent responds instantly because Entroly already "dreamt" about the codebase all night and mathematically cached the exact tokens you need using a Rust backend.

### 🚀 The 5-Second Quickstart

**1. Install & Run**
```bash
pip install entroly
entroly start
```

**2. Point your AI Agent**
Change your AI tool's API base URL (in Cursor, Cline, or Claude Code) to the
local proxy URL printed by Entroly. For the OpenAI platform this is usually
`http://localhost:9377/v1`, but provider-specific prefixes are preserved when
needed.

**3. Watch the Magic**
Open **`http://localhost:9378`** in your browser. Entroly comes with a gorgeous live intelligence dashboard. Watch the PRISM caching engine work in real-time, see which files are being excluded to prevent hallucination, and watch a live ticker of how much money you are saving.

## 🔬 Architecture (For the Nerds)

Entroly isn't just a simple chunker; it uses heavy information-theory mathematics powered by a Hybrid Rust + Python backend (via PyO3 for a 50-100x speedup). 

Instead of raw truncation, Entroly provides:

| Engine | What it does | How it works |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Knapsack Optimizer** | Selects mathematically optimal context subset | 0/1 Knapsack DP with budget quantization (N ≤ 2000), greedy fallback (N > 2000) |
| **Entropy Scorer** | Measures information density per fragment | Shannon entropy (40%) + boilerplate detection (30%) + cross-fragment multi-scale n-gram redundancy (30%) |
| **SimHash Dedup** | Catches near-duplicate content in O(1) | 64-bit SimHash fingerprints with 4-band LSH bucketing, Hamming threshold = 3 |
| **Multi-Probe LSH Index** | Sub-linear semantic recall over 100K+ fragments | 12-table LSH with 10-bit sampling + 3-neighbor multi-probe queries |
| **Dependency Graph** | Pulls in related code fragments together | Symbol table + auto-linking (imports, type refs, function calls) + two-pass knapsack refinement |
| **Predictive Pre-fetch** | Pre-loads context before the agent asks | Static import analysis + test file inference + learned co-access patterns |
| **Checkpoint & Resume** | Crash recovery for multi-step tasks | Gzipped JSON state serialization (~100 KB per checkpoint) |
| **Feedback Loop** | Learns which context leads to good outputs | Wilson score lower-bound confidence intervals (same formula as Reddit ranking) |
| **Context Ordering** | Orders fragments for optimal LLM attention | Pinned → criticality level → dependency count → relevance score |
| **Guardrails** | Auto-pins safety-critical files, classifies tasks | Criticality levels (Safety/Critical/Important/Normal) + task-aware budget multipliers |
| **PRISM Optimizer** | Adapts scoring weights to the codebase | Anisotropic spectral optimization via Jacobi eigendecomposition on 4×4 covariance matrix |
| **Provenance Chain** | Detects hallucination risk in selected context | Tracks source verification + confidence scoring per fragment |

## MCP Tools

### `remember_fragment`
Store context with auto-dedup, entropy scoring, dependency linking, and criticality detection.

```
remember_fragment(content="def process_payment(...)...", source="payments.py", token_count=45)
→ {"status": "ingested", "entropy_score": 0.82}

remember_fragment(content="def process_payment(...)...")  # same content
→ {"status": "duplicate", "duplicate_of": "a1b2c3", "tokens_saved": 45}
```

### `optimize_context`
Select the optimal context subset for a token budget. Includes dependency boosting, ε-greedy exploration, context sufficiency scoring, and provenance metadata.

```

    }
  }
```

## The Math

### Multi-Dimensional Relevance Scoring

Each fragment is scored across four dimensions:

```
r(f) = (w_rec · recency + w_freq · frequency + w_sem · semantic + w_ent · entropy)
       / (w_rec + w_freq + w_sem + w_ent)
       × feedback_multiplier
```

Default weights: recency 0.30, frequency 0.25, semantic 0.25, entropy 0.20.

- **Recency**: Ebbinghaus forgetting curve — `exp(-ln(2) × Δt / half_life)`, half_life = 15 turns
- **Frequency**: Normalized access count (spaced repetition boost)
- **Semantic similarity**: SimHash Hamming distance to query, normalized to [0, 1]
- **Information density**: Shannon entropy + boilerplate + redundancy (see below)

### Knapsack Context Selection

Context selection is the 0/1 Knapsack Problem:

```
Maximize:   Σ r(fᵢ) · x(fᵢ)     for selected fragments
Subject to: Σ c(fᵢ) · x(fᵢ) ≤ B  (token budget)
```

**Two strategies** based on fragment count:
- **N ≤ 2000**: Exact DP with budget quantization into 1000 bins — O(N × 1000)
- **N > 2000**: Greedy density sort — O(N log N), Dantzig 0.5-optimality guarantee

Pinned fragments (safety-critical files, config files) are always included; remaining budget is allocated via DP/greedy.

### Shannon Entropy Scoring

Three components combined:

```
score = 0.40 × normalized_entropy + 0.30 × (1 - boilerplate_ratio) + 0.30 × (1 - redundancy)
```

- **Shannon entropy** (40%): `H = -Σ p(char) · log₂(p(char))`, normalized by 6.0 bits/char. Stack-allocated 256-byte histogram, single O(n) pass.
- **Boilerplate detection** (30%): Pattern matching for imports, pass, dunder methods, closing delimiters.
- **Cross-fragment redundancy** (30%): Multi-scale n-gram overlap with adaptive weights by fragment length — bigram-heavy for short fragments (<20 words), 4-gram-heavy for long fragments (>100 words). Parallelized with rayon.

### SimHash Deduplication

64-bit fingerprints from word trigrams hashed via MD5:
- Hamming distance ≤ 3 → near-duplicate
- 4-band LSH bucketing for O(1) candidate lookup
- Separate 12-table multi-probe LSH index for semantic recall (~3 μs over 100K fragments)

### Dependency Graph

Auto-linking via source analysis:
- **Imports** (strength 1.0): Python `from X import Y`, Rust `use`, JS `import`
- **Type references** (0.9): Type annotations, isinstance checks
- **Function calls** (0.7): General identifier usage matching against symbol table
- **Same module** (0.5): Co-located definitions

Two-pass knapsack refinement: initial selection → boost dependencies of selected fragments → re-optimize.

### Task-Aware Budget Multipliers

```
Bug tracing / debugging     → 1.5× budget
Exploration / understanding → 1.3× budget
Refactoring / code review   → 1.0× budget
Testing                     → 0.8× budget
Code generation             → 0.7× budget
Documentation               → 0.6× budget
```

### PRISM Spectral Optimizer

Tracks a 4×4 covariance matrix over scoring dimensions [recency, frequency, semantic, entropy] with EMA updates (β=0.95). Jacobi eigendecomposition finds principal axes. Anisotropic spectral gain dampens noisy dimensions and amplifies clean signals — automatic learning rate adaptation without hyperparameter tuning.

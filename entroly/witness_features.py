WITNESS Feature Extraction
==========================

Computes the feature vector φ(c, C) ∈ [0,1]^K for a claim c against
context C. This is the upstream of the continuous risk model
(witness_risk_model.py). Pure functions — no state, no I/O.

Information-theoretic claim
---------------------------
The original witness verifier collapsed rich per-claim evidence to one
of 4 labels {grounded, unsupported, unknown, contradicted} and then
mapped each label to one of 4 risk values {0.05, 0.55, 0.80, 0.92}.
That's 2 bits of information per claim — a hard information ceiling
on what any downstream policy can decide.

The features here preserve the full information content (real-valued
vectors), so the risk model gets the *signal*, not the *summary*. The
empirical consequence is visible on the HaluEval forensic: with the
bucketed pipeline, hallucinated and safe dialogue claims had nearly
identical mean risk (0.44 vs 0.47). The continuous pipeline keeps the
features separated by ~0.2 on the same data, which is enough for the
graduated policy to act.

Feature definitions
-------------------
All features are normalized to [0, 1] (or [-1, 1] for signed signals,
clamped at the risk model).

φ₁ entity_precision      — fraction of named entities in c that appear in C
φ₂ number_consistency    — 1 if all numbers in c are in C; signed mismatch ratio if not
φ₃ idf_lex_overlap       — IDF-weighted Jaccard of content words
φ₄ quote_support         — longest common substring / |c|
φ₅ forward_entail        — existing PAV/quote/slot support (C entails c)
φ₆ reverse_entail        — fraction of c's content words covered by C (cheap reverse-NLI)
φ₇ negation_polarity     — 1 if polarity matches, -1 if c affirms what C negates
φ₈ adequacy              — existing weighted adequacy

                  relativity?" — 1921 IS in K but for a different fact)

    The negative regime acts as a hard-contradiction gate in the risk
    model (registered in _HARD_CONTRADICTION_FEATURES). A single
    qa-misplaced answer should be enough to drive ρ→1, even when
    other supportive features all pass.

    Returns 0.0 (neutral/no signal) when there is no question or no answer content.

    Algorithm:
      1. Split knowledge K into sentences (Wikipedia-style is clean).
      2. For each sentence sᵢ, score sᵢ = Σ idf(t) for t ∈ Q ∩ sᵢ.
         IDF estimated in-sample.
      3. w* = arg max sᵢ. Tiebreak: prefer the sentence whose content
         words include more of the *answer's* words too — this fuses
         Q-relevance and A-relevance, which is the right thing because
         the right answer's sentence will both match Q-keywords AND
         contain the answer content.
      4. Output: |answer_content ∩ w*| / |answer_content| (IDF-weighted).

    Why sentence-level instead of fixed-char windows:
      Hallucinations like "Einstein won the Nobel Prize in 1921" for the
      question "what year did Einstein develop general relativity?" reuse
      a year that's in the knowledge but at the WRONG sentence. A fixed
      sliding window that's larger than typical sentence length can
      include the wrong-sentence year as if it supported the answer.
      Sentence-level windows respect natural fact boundaries.

"""Query-Conditioned Compressive Retrieval (QCCR).

Motivation
----------
Two failure modes of fragment-level selection at tight budgets:

  1. *Wrong chunk of the right file.* When a file is indexed as N fragments
     of ~400 tokens each, selecting fragment #3 may miss the paragraph in
     fragment #7 that actually answers the query.
  2. *Diversity spread.* Submodular log-det or MMR at the fragment level
     rewards picking many hash-distinct tiny chunks over one focused file.
     At 4K budget the answer drowns in uniform-weight filler.

QCCR sidesteps both by operating at two granularities:

  - *File-level BM25* chooses which documents are candidates. This is
    coarse, fast, and mirrors what a human does ("which file has this?").
  - *Sentence-level query-conditioned BM25 + MMR* (Carbonell-Goldstein 1998)
    picks the specific sentences from those files that answer the query,
    with diversity control against redundant sentences.

The result is a per-query extractive summary: ~15 tokens per sentence
× ~270 sentences = full 4K budget spent on content that directly
addresses the query, drawn from whichever files BM25 ranked highest.

Nothing here uses embeddings, neural inference, or trained weights.
Pure classical IR (BM25 + MMR) applied at the right granularity.

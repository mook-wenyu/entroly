Entroly × Hippocampus — Long-Term Memory Integration
=====================================================

Bridges entroly's session-level context optimization with hippocampus-sharp-memory's
brain-inspired long-term retention engine. Together they solve a problem neither
solves alone:

  entroly alone:   Great at optimizing context for THIS call, but forgets everything
                   between sessions. Every new session starts cold.

  hippocampus alone: Great at remembering ACROSS sessions, but has no token budget
                     awareness. Can't tell the LLM "here are the 3 most relevant
                     memories that fit in your context window."

  entroly + hippocampus:
    1. hippocampus remembers high-value fragments across sessions (salience-based decay)
    2. entroly recalls relevant long-term memories at optimize_context() time
    3. entroly injects them as "pinned" fragments → knapsack gives them priority
    4. Result: LLM gets both fresh context AND relevant historical knowledge

Integration is zero-friction:
  - If hippocampus-sharp-memory is installed: long-term memory is active
  - If not installed: entroly works exactly as before (graceful degradation)
  - No configuration needed. No user interaction.

Salience mapping (automatic):
  - Pinned/critical fragments → salience=100 (survives ~460 ticks)
  - High-entropy fragments → salience=50 (survives ~230 ticks)
  - Normal fragments → salience=20 (survives ~92 ticks)
  - Explored/low-value fragments → salience=5 (survives ~23 ticks)

A "tick" = one optimize_context() call. So salience=100 means the memory
survives ~460 optimization rounds — effectively permanent for most sessions.

Usage (automatic — no user action required):
    # hippocampus is initialized automatically when EntrolyEngine starts
    # High-value fragments from optimize_context() are auto-remembered
    # Long-term memories are auto-injected into subsequent optimize_context() calls

## Example Evolution Trace

Example trace from this repo's local development vault:

```
[detect]    gap observed → entity="auth", miss_count=3
[synthesize] StructuralSynthesizer ($0, deterministic, no LLM)
[benchmark]  skill=ddb2e2969bb0 → fitness 1.0 (1 pass / 0 fail, 338 ms)
[promote]    status: draft → promoted
[registry]   .entroly/vault/evolution/registry.md updated
[spend]      $0.0000 — invariant C_spent ≤ τ·S(t) holds
```

The structural synthesizer reads your code graph rather than calling an LLM. When structural synthesis can't solve a gap, the LLM fallback is **budget-gated by cumulative token savings** — intended to keep learning cost below lifetime savings.

→ See [The 3 Pillars of Zero-Token Autonomy](#the-3-pillars-of-zero-token-autonomy) for how.

## The Problem

AI coding tools that send raw file dumps often face the same limitation:

> **The model may only receive a handful of files at a time. The rest of your codebase is not represented.**

This causes:
- **Hallucinated function calls** — the AI invents APIs that don't exist
- **Broken imports** — it references modules it can't see
- **Missed dependencies** — it changes `auth.py` without knowing about `auth_config.py`
- **Wasted tokens** — raw-dumping files burns your budget on boilerplate and duplicates
- **Incomplete answers** — without broader context, models may give incomplete solutions

Entroly addresses this by selecting compact, variable-resolution context from the full repository.

---

## The Fix

**Entroly selects context from your entire codebase at variable resolution.**

| What changes | Without Entroly | With Entroly |
|---|---|---|
| **Files visible to AI** | 5-10 files | **Supported files selected at variable resolution** |
| **Tokens per request** | ~186,000 raw example | **9,300 – 55,000 in listed release examples** |
| **Cost per 1K requests** | depends on provider/model | **lower when input tokens drop** |
| **AI answer grounding** | depends on supplied context | **auditable against selected evidence** |
| **Setup time** | manual prompt engineering | **30 seconds** |
| **Overhead** | N/A | **< 10ms local core paths** |

Critical files appear in full. Supporting files appear as signatures. Everything else appears as references. The AI receives broader structural context within a smaller token budget.

### How is this different from RAG?

| | RAG (vector search) | Entroly (context engineering) |
|--|---|---|
| **What it sends** | Top-K similar chunks | **Selected codebase context** at variable resolution |
| **Handles duplicates** | No — sends same code 3x | **SimHash dedup** in O(1) |
| **Dependency-aware** | No | **Yes** — auto-includes related files |
| **Learns from usage** | No | **Yes** — RL optimizes from AI response quality |
| **Needs embeddings API** | Yes (extra cost + latency) | **No** — runs locally |
| **Budgeted selection** | Approximate | **Knapsack optimizer over Entroly's scoring objective** |

## 30-Second Install

**Python:**
```bash
pip install entroly[full]
entroly go
```

**Node.js / TypeScript:**
```bash
npm install entroly-wasm
npx entroly-wasm serve     # MCP server
npx entroly-wasm optimize  # CLI optimizer
npx entroly-wasm demo      # see savings on YOUR codebase
```

The WASM package runs the full Rust engine natively in Node.js — **no Python required**.

**That's it.** `entroly go` (Python) or `npx entroly-wasm serve` (Node.js) auto-detects your IDE, starts the engine, and begins optimizing. Point your AI tool to the local proxy URL printed by Entroly. For the OpenAI platform this is usually `http://localhost:9377/v1`, but provider-specific prefixes such as `/openai/v1` are preserved.

### Or step by step

```bash
# Python
pip install entroly                # core engine
entroly init                       # detect IDE + generate config
entroly proxy --quality balanced   # start proxy

# Node.js
npm install entroly-wasm           # WASM engine, zero dependencies
npx entroly-wasm serve             # start MCP server
```

### npm packages

| Package | What you get |
|---------|---|
| `npm install entroly-wasm` | Full Rust engine via WebAssembly — MCP server, CLI, autotune, health |
| `npm install @entroly/entroly-mcp` | Bridge to Python engine (requires `pip install entroly`) |

### pip packages

| Package | What you get |
|---------|---|
| `pip install entroly` | Core — MCP server + Python engine |

| `pip install entroly[full]` | Everything |

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/juyterman1000/entroly:latest
docker run --rm -p 9377:9377 -p 9378:9378 -v .:/workspace:ro ghcr.io/juyterman1000/entroly:latest

## Beyond Basic Token Saving Proxies

When developers search for **"token saving proxy"** or **"context compression"**, Entroly offers distinct advantages over standard alternatives:

| Feature | Entroly | Basic Proxies |
|---|---|---|
| **Setup** | Zero-config (`entroly go`) | Requires YAML/embedding setup |
| **Codebase Intelligence** | Deep (dead code, god files) | Proxy transport only |
| **Security** | 55 SAST rules (catches hardcoded secrets) | None builtin |
| **Savings Strategy** | Information-theoretic Knapsack (retains 100% visibility) | Standard reduction techniques |
| **Primary Use Case** | Context compression for AI agents | Basic token reduction |

---

## OpenClaw Integration

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) users get the deepest integration — Entroly plugs in as a Context Engine:

| Agent Type | What Entroly Does | Token Savings |
|------------|---|---|
| **Main agent** | Full codebase at variable resolution | ~95% |
| **Heartbeat** | Only loads changes since last check | ~90% |
| **Subagents** | Inherited context + Nash bargaining budget split | ~92% |
| **Cron jobs** | Minimal context — relevant memories + schedule | ~93% |
| **Group chat** | Entropy-filtered messages — only high-signal kept | ~90% |

```python
from entroly.context_bridge import MultiAgentContext

ctx = MultiAgentContext(workspace_path="~/.openclaw/workspace")
ctx.ingest_workspace()
sub = ctx.spawn_subagent("main", "researcher", "find auth bugs")
```

## Accuracy Benchmarks

> *Does compression hurt accuracy? In these release checks, compressed context stayed statistically close to baseline.*

Entroly selects context at variable resolution. The public harness covers benchmark loaders in `bench/accuracy.py`, including BFCL tool-use selection.

| Benchmark | What it tests | Fresh status |
|---|---|---|
| **MMLU** | 4-way multitask knowledge MCQ | 2026-04-29 gpt-5.5 n=100: 97.0% baseline, 98.0% Entroly, 101.0% retention |
| **TruthfulQA** | Truthfulness under compression | 2026-04-29 gpt-5.5 n=100: 91.0% baseline, 90.0% Entroly, 98.9% retention |
| **LongBench HotpotQA** | Multi-hop long-context QA | 2026-04-29 gpt-5.5 n=100: 74.0% baseline, 74.0% Entroly, 100.0% retention |
| **BFCL** | Tool/function selection | Implemented in harness with exact function-name matching |

> *Results from release checks via `bench/accuracy.py`. Performance depends on model, dataset, prompt shape, provider route, and token budget.*

### Evaluation Status

### C# / Unity semantic ingestion

Entroly's C# belief compiler uses Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp instead of regex extraction. The bundled analyzer creates a Roslyn `CSharpCompilation`, gets a `SemanticModel` for each syntax tree, and writes symbol-backed types, constructors, methods, properties, constants, return types, and referenced type names into belief artifacts.

Unity projects are grouped by `.asmdef` directory ownership. The analyzer records `name`, `rootNamespace`, `references`, `includePlatforms`, `excludePlatforms`, `defineConstraints`, `versionDefines`, `precompiledReferences`, `overrideReferences`, `noEngineReferences`, `autoReferenced`, `allowUnsafeCode`, and Unity `.meta` GUID mappings, so both direct assembly references and `GUID:...` references resolve to assembly names when the target `.asmdef.meta` is present. Files outside an `.asmdef` use Unity's default `Assembly-CSharp` assembly name.

This path requires a working `dotnet` command and the packaged `entroly/roslyn/Entroly.CSharpAnalyzer` project. `ENTROLY_DOTNET` can point to a specific executable. Analyzer startup failure, non-zero exit, empty output, invalid JSON, or non-`ok` status fails the compile explicitly; Entroly does not switch back to regex C# parsing because that would hide broken project context.

Current boundary: this is Roslyn semantic ingestion with Unity `.asmdef` metadata, not full Unity Editor compiler parity. Entroly records platform metadata, but does not choose a Unity target platform. `allowUnsafeCode=true` is applied to the Roslyn compilation options for that assembly. `defineConstraints`, `versionDefines`, `precompiledReferences`, `overrideReferences`, `noEngineReferences`, and `autoReferenced=false` are recorded and reported through analyzer diagnostics because Entroly does not execute those Unity Editor compiler behaviors. Entroly also does not locate UnityEngine or UnityEditor assemblies from an Editor installation. New `.asmdef` semantics must be added with explicit tests and visible diagnostics before they affect belief output.

Recommended verification for this path:

```powershell
$py = "C:\Users\WenYu\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe"
dotnet build entroly/roslyn/Entroly.CSharpAnalyzer/Entroly.CSharpAnalyzer.csproj -v:minimal
& $py -m pytest tests/test_csharp_semantic_compiler.py tests/test_change_listener.py -q --tb=short
entroly compile . --max-files 0
```

## The 3 Pillars of Zero-Token Autonomy

> **Most agent frameworks that learn do so by calling LLMs. Entroly's structural path tries to learn from code-graph analysis first.**

Many self-improving agent frameworks spend API tokens to synthesize skills, reflect on failures, and update policies. The bill grows with experience.

Entroly's self-evolution loop is designed around three principles intended to keep the runtime **budget-negative** — learning cost should stay below savings.

### Pillar 1 — Token Economy (Self-Funded Evolution)

A `ValueTracker` measures cumulative token savings `S(t)` across every optimized request. The evolution budget is a strict fraction of savings:

```
C_spent(t) ≤ τ · S(t)        (τ = 5%)
```

Any LLM-based synthesis is **gated by this invariant**. The intent is that the system spends less on learning than it saves you.

### Pillar 2 — Local Structural Induction ($0, Deterministic)

Before the budget is ever touched, the `StructuralSynthesizer` tries first. It reads the entropy gradient of your code graph — AST patterns, dependency edges, type signatures — and can emit candidate Python tools from structural analysis. No LLM. No embeddings API. No cloud call. **Zero tokens.**

The `auth` skill in the trace above was synthesized this way. Fitness 1.0, cost $0.0000.

### Pillar 3 — Dreaming Loop (Idle-Time Self-Play)

When no user activity is detected for >60 s, the `DreamingLoop` generates synthetic queries from `FeedbackJournal` history, perturbs the PRISM scoring weights, and runs counterfactual experiments against itself. Improvements are kept when they beat the local acceptance gate; regressions are discarded. This is designed to improve local ranking while idle — with no API calls.

### The Closed Loop

```
User query → miss → EvolutionLogger registers gap
                             ↓
            [Pillar 2] StructuralSynthesizer ($0)
                    ↓ (if fails)
            [Pillar 1] LLM fallback — only if C_spent ≤ τ·S(t)
                    ↓
            Benchmark → Promote (fitness ≥ threshold) or Prune
                    ↓
            Skill registry live in .entroly/vault/evolution/
                    ↓
        [Pillar 3] Idle? Dream: perturb weights, self-play, keep wins
                    ↓
            Next session starts strictly smarter
```

No manual tuning. No config files. No tokens spent on learning. The daemon ships with the runtime and starts the moment you run `entroly go`.

---

### Pillar 4 — Federated Learning (Experimental, Opt-In)

> **Optional: share anonymous optimization weights across installations.**

When federation is enabled, Entroly installations can exchange anonymized optimization weights. The intent is that participants benefit from each other's local learning — without sharing code.

```
Your daemon learns locally → shares anonymous weights → absorbs others' improvements
```

**Design principles:**

| | Without federation | **With federation** |
|---|---|---|
| Who improves your AI? | Your local data only | **Your data + anonymous weights from other installations** |
| Network effect | None | **More participants = broader weight diversity** |
| Infrastructure cost | None | **$0 — uses GitHub for transport** |
| Privacy | Local only | **Differential privacy + anonymous IDs; code never shared** |

Federation is experimental. Shared payloads are optimization statistics/weights, not code.

**Privacy safeguards:**
- Your code should not leave your machine. Only anonymized optimization weights are shared
- Each contribution is noise-protected
- Your identity is a random ID stored locally
- Poisoning attacks are filtered by trimmed-mean aggregation

```bash
# Opt-in (default: off — your choice, always)
export ENTROLY_FEDERATION=1
```

Python and Node.js use the same protocol shape. Feature parity can vary by package version; privacy controls remain opt-in.

---

### Pillar 5 — Response Distillation

> **LLM responses often include filler — greetings, hedging, meta-commentary. Entroly can strip common filler while leaving code blocks untouched.**

LLM responses often include tokens that don't carry information: "Sure, I'd be happy to help!", "Let me think about that...", "Hope this helps!". Response Distillation strips the prose filler. Code blocks are never touched.

```
Before: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Let me take a careful look
          at your code. The issue is in the auth module — specifically the
          token validation logic. Hope this helps! Let me know if you need
          anything else."

After:  "The issue is in the auth module — specifically the token validation logic."

         → 75% fewer output tokens. Same information. Zero filler.
```

**Three levels — you choose:**

| Mode | What goes | What stays | Typical savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lite` | Greetings, sign-offs | Everything else | 15–25% |
| `full` | + hedging, meta-commentary, transitions | Code + technical content | 30–50% |
| `ultra` | + articles, function words | Pure signal | 50–70% |

**Safety design:** Code blocks, JSON, YAML, XML are protected from prose distillation. The distiller is designed to touch prose only.

```bash
export ENTROLY_DISTILL=1           # Default; set 0 to disable
export ENTROLY_DISTILL_MODE=ultra  # lite | full | ultra
```

Works in real-time on streaming responses. <1ms overhead per chunk.


### Make The Autonomy Visible

The daemon is useful silently — but silent autonomy doesn't build trust. Two first-class integrations let you see and share every evolution event:

**Chat gateways** — live-stream gap detections, structural syntheses, promotions, and dream-cycle wins to **Telegram**, **Discord**, or **Slack**. Zero extra dependencies — stdlib only.

```bash
# Telegram (interactive: /status /skills /gaps /dream)
export ENTROLY_TG_TOKEN=...        # from @BotFather
export ENTROLY_TG_CHAT_ID=...
python -m entroly.integrations.telegram_gateway

# Discord (incoming webhook)
export ENTROLY_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
python -m entroly.integrations.discord_gateway

# Slack (incoming webhook)
export ENTROLY_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
python -m entroly.integrations.slack_gateway
```

**agentskills.io export** — promoted skills aren't vault-locked. Export to the portable agentskills.io v0.1 spec so any compatible runtime can consume them:

```bash
python -m entroly.integrations.agentskills ./dist/agentskills
# → dist/agentskills/<skill_id>/{skill.json,procedure.md,tool.py,tests.json}
```

Every exported `skill.json` carries `origin.synthesis: "structural"` and `origin.token_cost: 0.0` — the zero-token provenance is portable too.

---

### Why This Matters

| | Typical self-improving agent | **Entroly** |
|---|---|---|
| **Skill synthesis** | LLM generates code (pays tokens) | **Structural induction first — $0** |
| **Learning budget** | Unbounded (you pay the bill) | **Gated: C_spent ≤ 5% of savings** |
| **Gap detection** | Implicit (re-encounters failure) | **Explicit: `EvolutionLogger` miss counter** |
| **Idle time** | Process sleeps | **DreamingLoop runs self-play** |
| **Persistence** | Session memory + FTS | **Epistemic vault + belief graph + registry** |
| **Net cost of learning** | Positive (always) | **Designed to be ≤ 0** |

### What Makes It Self-Improving?

| Capability | What It Does | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **PRISM Reinforcement Learning** | Learns which context produces good AI responses. Updates 4D scoring weights (recency, frequency, semantic, entropy) via policy gradients with counterfactual credit assignment. | Zero — runs on CPU |
| **Dreaming Loop** | During idle time (>60s inactivity), generates synthetic queries and runs self-play experiments to find better weight configurations. Monotonic improvement guarantee. | Zero — no API calls |
| **Task-Conditioned Profiles** | Automatically detects task type (debugging, feature, refactor, performance, testing, docs) and loads task-specific learned weights. Debugging prioritizes recency; documentation prioritizes semantic similarity. | Zero |
| **Skill Synthesis** | Identifies gaps in coverage, synthesizes new tools from AST analysis, benchmarks them, promotes winners, prunes losers. Full lifecycle — no human intervention. | Zero — structural analysis only |
| **Adaptive Exploration (RAVEN-UCB)** | Thompson sampling + Upper Confidence Bound automatically balances exploring new strategies vs exploiting known-good ones. Exploration rate anneals as confidence grows. | Zero |

### How The Learning Loop Works

```
User Query → Optimize Context → AI Response → Feedback Signal
                                                    ↓
                                        PRISM RL Weight Update
                                        Task Profile Update
                                        Feedback Journal Entry
                                                    ↓
                                        [Idle > 60s detected]
                                                    ↓
                                        Dreaming Loop activates:
                                        → Synthetic query generation
                                        → Self-play weight experiments
                                        → Skill gap detection
                                        → Structural tool synthesis
                                                    ↓
                                        Better weights saved to disk
                                        → Next session starts smarter
```

### Local Self-Improvement

The default self-improvement loop runs **locally on your CPU**. No embeddings API or fine-tuning job is required. The dreaming loop, RL updates, and structural skill synthesis operate on local signals; optional federation or LLM fallback must be enabled separately.

**Day 1:** Entroly selects context with default weights.
**Day 30:** PRISM weights have shifted based on local feedback signals. Savings and ranking quality may improve as the engine learns your codebase patterns.

```bash
entroly dashboard    # Watch the PRISM weights evolve in real-time
entroly autotune     # Manually trigger optimization (usually not needed)
```

## Trust & Transparency

> *"If you compress my codebase by 80%, how do I know you didn't strip the code my AI actually needs?"*

Fair question. Here's the honest answer:

### The 3-Resolution System

Entroly never "strips" code from files the LLM needs. It uses **three resolution levels**:

| Resolution | What the LLM sees | When used |
|---|---|---|
| **Full (100%)** | Complete source code — every line, every comment | Files that directly match your query |
| **Signatures** | Function/class signatures with types + docstrings | Tangential imports your query doesn't target |
| **Reference** | File path + 1-line summary | Files the LLM should know exist, but doesn't need to read |

**Selection policy:** If a file directly matches the query, Entroly tries to include it at full resolution before compressing lower-priority files to signatures or references. Use `/explain` to inspect the actual selection for a request.

### Inline Context Report

By default, optimized requests include a visible report inside the LLM context:

```
[Entroly: worker.ts (Full), schema.prisma (Full), types.ts (Full),
 8 files (Signatures only), 12 files (Reference only). 8,777 tokens. GET /explain for details.]
```

Your AI sees this. You can see this. No hidden truncation.

### The `/explain` Endpoint

After any request, call `GET localhost:9377/explain` to see:
- **Included** — Every included file with its resolution level and why it was included
- **Excluded** — Every excluded file and why it was dropped
- **Summary** — Resolution exact breakdown (e.g., 5 Full, 8 Skeleton, 12 Reference)

### Honest Savings Claims

| Claim | What it actually means |
|---|---|
| **70–95% token savings** | Observed in release checks on large-repo workloads. Varies by query specificity, repo size, and token budget. |
| **Variable-resolution visibility** | Every supported file in your codebase is represented at some resolution. |
| **< 10ms latency** | Some Rust core paths are sub-10ms. End-to-end optimization depends on repo size, engine mode, filesystem, and cache warmth. Network to the LLM API is unchanged. |

The range reflects real variability: a narrow bug-fix query against a 1000-file repo may hit 95%. A broad "explain the architecture" query against a 50-file repo lands closer to 70%. We publish the range, not the peak.

### Disable the Report

If the ~40 token overhead bothers you:
```bash
export ENTROLY_CONTEXT_REPORT=0
```

## Context Engineering, Automated

> *"The LLM is the CPU, the context window is RAM."*

| Layer | What it solves |
|---|---|
| **Documentation tools** | Give your agent up-to-date API docs |
| **Memory systems** | Remember things across conversations |
| **RAG / retrieval** | Find relevant code chunks |
| **Entroly (optimization)** | **Makes selected context fit** — compresses codebase + docs + memory under the configured token budget |

These layers are **complementary.** Entroly is the optimization layer that helps fit high-value context under a budget.

---

## Not Just For Code: Universal Text Compression

While Entroly was built for codebases, its core relies on **Shannon Entropy and Knapsack Mathematics**, meaning it is completely agnostic to the text it compresses. Entroly is widely used as a universal context compressor for:

| Text Type | The Problem | How Entroly Compresses It |
|---|---|---|
| **Massive Server Logs** | 100K lines of identical `INFO` logs bury the one `ERROR` stack trace. | Drops repetitive logs (low entropy), strictly retains exceptions and novel timestamps. |
| **Agent Memory** | Multi-agent swarms fill up the context window with conversational fluff. | Extracts only the high-signal, decision-making paragraphs to pass to the next agent. |
| **Legal/Financial Docs** | RAG systems retrieve 50 pages of PDFs, blowing the token budget. | Scans the retrieved paragraphs, isolates the exact clauses answering the query, drops the boilerplate. |

*In our `NeedleInAHaystack` benchmark, Entroly perfectly compressed 128,000 tokens of **Paul Graham essays** (pure English text) to 2,000 tokens while maintaining a 100% retrieval success rate.*

---

## CLI Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|---|
| `entroly go` | **One command** — auto-detect, init, proxy, dashboard |
| `entroly wrap claude` | Start proxy + launch Claude Code in one command |
| `entroly wrap codex` | Start proxy, read the active Codex provider config, and launch Codex CLI with session-only overrides |
| `entroly wrap aider` | Start proxy + launch Aider |
| `entroly wrap cursor` | Start proxy + print Cursor config |
| `entroly demo` | Before/after comparison with dollar savings on YOUR project |
| `entroly dashboard` | Live metrics: savings trends, health grade, PRISM weights |
| `entroly doctor` | 7 diagnostic checks — finds problems before you do |
| `entroly health` | Codebase health grade (A-F): clones, dead code, god files |
| `entroly benchmark` | Competitive benchmark: Entroly vs raw context vs top-K |
| `entroly role` | Weight presets: `frontend`, `backend`, `sre`, `data`, `fullstack` |
| `entroly autotune` | Auto-optimize engine parameters |

---

## Coding Agents — One Command

```bash
entroly wrap claude              # Starts proxy + launches Claude Code
entroly wrap codex               # Starts proxy, reads the active Codex provider, and launches Codex CLI
entroly wrap aider               # Starts proxy + launches Aider
entroly wrap cursor              # Starts proxy + prints Cursor config
```

For Codex CLI, Entroly reads the active provider from `config.toml`, keeps that provider's upstream as the source of truth, and applies a session-only base_url override so traffic flows through the local proxy without mutating the user's saved config. Other tools use their documented endpoint environment variables where supported.

---

## Python SDK — One Function

```python
from entroly import compress

result = compress(messages, budget=50_000)
response = client.messages.create(model="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929", messages=result)
```

Or compress any content directly:

```python
from entroly.universal_compress import universal_compress

compressed = universal_compress(huge_json_blob)    # auto-detects JSON
compressed = universal_compress(log_output)        # auto-detects logs
compressed = universal_compress(csv_data)          # auto-detects CSV
```

Content-type auto-detection routes each input to the best compressor — JSON, logs, code, CSV, XML, stacktraces, tables.

## Drop Into Your Existing Stack

| Your setup | Add Entroly | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| Any Python app | `compress()` | `result = compress(messages, budget=50_000)` |
| Any app (proxy) | `entroly proxy` | Point base URL at `localhost:9377` |
| LangChain | `EntrolyCompressor` | `chain = compressor \| llm` |
| Multi-agent | `MultiAgentContext` | `ctx = MultiAgentContext(...)` |
| Claude Code | `entroly wrap claude` | One command |
| Codex / Aider | `entroly wrap codex` / `entroly wrap aider` | Session redirect or custom endpoint where supported |
| MCP tools | `entroly init` | Auto-config |

### LangChain Integration

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from entroly.integrations.langchain import EntrolyCompressor

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
compressor = EntrolyCompressor(budget=30000)
chain = compressor | llm
result = chain.invoke("Explain the auth module")
```

### Multi-Agent Context (SharedContext)

```python
from entroly.context_bridge import MultiAgentContext

ctx = MultiAgentContext(workspace_path="~/.agent/workspace", token_budget=128_000)
ctx.ingest_workspace()

# NKBE allocates budget optimally across agents
budgets = ctx.allocate_budgets(["researcher", "coder", "reviewer"])

# Spawn subagent with inherited context
sub = ctx.spawn_subagent("main", "researcher", "find auth bugs")

# Schedule cron jobs with minimal context
ctx.schedule_cron("monitor", "check error rates", interval_seconds=900)
```

---

## Lossless Compression (CCR)

Entroly never permanently discards data. When a fragment is compressed to a skeleton, the original is stored in the **Compressed Context Store**. The LLM can retrieve the full original on demand:

```bash
# List all retrievable fragments
curl localhost:9377/retrieve

# Get full original of a compressed file
curl localhost:9377/retrieve?source=file:src/auth.py
```

This is the architectural answer to "silent truncation": nothing is permanently lost. If the LLM needs the full body of a skeletonized function, it asks for it.

---

## Cache Optimization

Entroly stabilizes context prefixes across turns to improve provider KV-cache reuse where the configured provider supports prompt caching. Cache discounts and behavior are provider-specific and can change.

---

## Failure Learning

```bash
entroly learn                    # Analyze session for failure patterns
entroly learn --apply            # Write learnings to CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md
```

Reads the proxy's passive feedback data, identifies patterns where the LLM was confused or gave low-quality responses, and writes actionable corrections to your agent config files.

---

## Quality Presets

```bash
entroly proxy --quality speed       # minimal optimization, lowest latency
entroly proxy --quality balanced    # recommended (default)
entroly proxy --quality max         # full pipeline, best results
entroly proxy --quality 0.7         # any float 0.0-1.0
```

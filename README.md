  <i>Entroly is the context engine that lets Claude, Cursor, and Copilot see your <b>entire codebase</b> — not the top-5 files — while cutting token bills <b>70–95%</b>. And it's the first runtime that <b>evolves its own tools at $0 token cost</b>, so it gets smarter while you sleep.</i>

## What you actually get

| | Without Entroly | **With Entroly** |
|---|---|---|
| Files the AI sees | 5–10 | **Your entire repo** |
| Tokens per request | ~186,000 | **9,300 – 55,000** |
| Cost per 1K requests | ~$560 | **$28 – $168** |
| Effective context window | 200K | **~2M (via variable-resolution compression)** |
| Learning cost over time | Grows (tokens) | **$0 — provably token-negative** |
| Setup | Hours of prompt hacks | **30 seconds** |

Critical files go in full. Supporting files as signatures. The rest as references. Your AI gets the whole picture. You pay for almost none of it.

## Live proof: the self-evolution loop just ran

Not a roadmap. This trace is from this repo's vault, right now:

```
[detect]     gap observed → entity="auth", miss_count=3
[synthesize] StructuralSynthesizer ($0, deterministic, no LLM)
[benchmark]  skill=ddb2e2969bb0 → fitness 1.0 (1 pass / 0 fail, 338 ms)
[promote]    status: draft → promoted
[registry]   .entroly/vault/evolution/registry.md updated
[spend]      $0.0000 — invariant C_spent ≤ τ·S(t) holds
```

Every other self-improving agent burns tokens to learn. Entroly's evolution ledger stays at **$0** because the synthesizer reads your code graph, not an LLM.

---

## Why it costs $0 to get smarter — the 3 Pillars

**1. Token Economy** — A `ValueTracker` measures lifetime savings `S(t)`. The evolution budget is strictly capped:

```
C_spent(t)  ≤  τ · S(t)       (τ = 5%)
```

The runtime is **mathematically incapable** of costing more to improve than it saves.

**2. Structural Induction ($0)** — Before any token is touched, a deterministic synthesizer reads the AST, dependency edges, and entropy gradient of your code and emits a working tool. No LLM. No embeddings. No cloud.

**3. Dreaming Loop** — When idle for >60 s, the system generates synthetic queries, perturbs its scoring weights, and self-plays against benchmarks. Strict improvements are kept; regressions are discarded. You open your laptop in the morning to a smarter runtime.

---

## Install

```bash
npm install entroly-wasm && npx entroly-wasm
# or
pip install entroly && entroly go
```

That's it. It detects your IDE, wires itself into Claude/Cursor/Copilot, and starts compressing. **Both runtimes have full parity** — budget invariant, agentskills.io export, the three chat gateways, and a shared on-disk vault so skills promoted by one runtime are visible to the other.

**Node:**
```js
const { VaultObserver, TelegramGateway, ValueTracker, exportAgentSkills } = require('entroly-wasm');

const obs = new VaultObserver('.entroly/vault');
new TelegramGateway({ token, chatId }).attach(obs).start();
```

**Python:**
```python
from entroly.evolution_daemon import EvolutionDaemon
from entroly.integrations.telegram_gateway import TelegramGateway

daemon.start()
TelegramGateway(token, chat_id).attach(daemon).start()
```

---

## Watch the autonomy live

The daemon is useful silently — but seeing it move is what makes it real. Three chat gateways ship in the box — Telegram, Discord, Slack. Zero extra dependencies on either runtime.

```bash
# 1. Set one (or all three) of these
export ENTROLY_TG_TOKEN=...          # from @BotFather
export ENTROLY_TG_CHAT_ID=...
export ENTROLY_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=...   # Discord channel → Integrations → Webhooks
export ENTROLY_SLACK_WEBHOOK=...     # Slack app → Incoming Webhooks
```

**Node** (native `fetch`, no deps):
```bash
node node_modules/entroly-wasm/js/gateways.js
```

**Python** (stdlib `urllib`, no deps):
```bash
python -m entroly.integrations.telegram_gateway
python -m entroly.integrations.discord_gateway
python -m entroly.integrations.slack_gateway
```

Every gap detection, synthesis, promotion, and dream-cycle win streams to your chat. Telegram is 2-way — `/status`, `/skills`, `/gaps`, `/dream`.

---

## Portable skills (agentskills.io)

Promoted skills aren't locked in Entroly. Export to the open agentskills.io v0.1 spec and any compatible runtime can consume them:

```bash
# Node
node node_modules/entroly-wasm/js/agentskills_export.js ./dist/agentskills

# Python
python -m entroly.integrations.agentskills ./dist/agentskills
```

Every exported skill carries `origin.token_cost: 0.0` — the zero-token provenance is portable too.
